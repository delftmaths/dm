    {
      "text": "What is the correct logical negation of the statement: \"For all real numbers $x$, $x^2 \\ge 0$\"?",
      "choices": [
        "For all real numbers $x$, $x^2 < 0$",
        "There exists a real number $x$ such that $x^2 < 0$",
        "There exists a real number $x$ such that $x^2 \\le 0$",
        "For some real numbers $x$, $x^2 \\ge 0$"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "To negate a universal quantifier ($\\forall$), we switch it to an existential quantifier ($\\exists$) and negate the condition. The negation of $\\ge$ is $<$, not $\\le$."

      "text": "Which statement is the correct negation of: \"If it rains, then the grass is wet\"?",
      "choices": [
        "If it rains, then the grass is not wet",
        "If it does not rain, then the grass is not wet",
        "It rains and the grass is not wet",
        "It does not rain and the grass is wet"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The negation of an implication $P \\implies Q$ is $P \\land \\neg Q$. The original statement only promises what happens if it rains; to disprove it, you need rain ($P$) <strong>and</strong> dry grass ($\\neg Q$)."

    {
      "text": "Consider the statement: \"For all real numbers $x$, if $x^2 < -1$, then $x = 100$.\" Is this statement true or false?",
      "choices": [
        "False, because $x$ cannot be $100$ if $x^2 < -1$.",
        "False, because $x^2$ is never negative.",
        "True (Vacuously True).",
        "Undefined."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "An implication $P \\implies Q$ is <strong>always true</strong> if the premise $P$ is false. Since $x^2 < -1$ is never true for real numbers, the implication holds \"vacuously\"."

      "choices": [
        "1. Find an example $x$. 2. Show that $P(x)$ implies $P(x+1)$.",
        "1. Show existence (find such an $x$). 2. Show uniqueness (assume $P(y)$ and $P(z)$ are true, then prove $y=z$).",

        "1. Show existence. 2. Show the contrapositive."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Uniqueness proofs always consist of two parts: proving at least one solution exists, and then proving that any two hypothetical solutions must actually be the same number."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "To prove $P \\implies Q$ by contradiction, we assume that $P$ is true but $Q$ is false. Here: $n^2$ is even ($P$) but $n$ is odd (not $Q$)."

Remove $H_{n+1}$. The set $\\{H_1, \\dots, H_n\\}$ has $n$ horses, so they match (by hypothesis).<br>2. Replace $H_{n+1}$ and remove $H_1$.

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The last two sentences uses that the two sets <strong>overlap</strong> in order to transfer the colour property.
