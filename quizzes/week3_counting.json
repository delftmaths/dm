  "text": "How many distinct ways can you rearrange the letters of the word <strong>LEVEL</strong>?",
  "choices": [
    "$5! = 120$",
    "$5! / 2! = 60$",
    "$5! / (2! \\cdot 2!) = 30$",
    "$2^5 = 32$"
  ],
  "correct": 2,
  "explanation": "If all letters were unique ($L_1 E_1 V E_2 L_2$), there would be $5!$ arrangements. <br>However, swapping the two 'L's doesn't change the word, so we divide by $2!$. Swapping the two 'E's also doesn't change it, so we divide by another $2!$. <br>Result: $120 / 4 = 30$."

      "text": "You want to send exactly one postcard to each of 12 friends. The shop has 3 kinds of postcards (in infinite supply). How many ways can you send them?",
      "choices": [
        "$12^3$",
        "$3^{12}$",
        "$\\binom{12}{3}$",
        "$3 \\times 12$"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "For each of the 12 friends, you have exactly 3 independent choices of which card to send. By the multiplication rule, this is $3 \\times 3 \\times \\dots \\times 3 = 3^{12}$."
    },
    {
      "text": "What if you still want to send exactly one postcard to each of 12 friends, but the shop only has exactly 4 copies of each of the 3 kinds of postcards?",

        "$\\binom{12}{3}$",
        "$\\frac{12!}{(4!)^3}$",
        "$12!$"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "You are dividing the 12 friends into 3 groups of 4 (each group gets a specific card type). This is a classic multinomial coefficient: $\\binom{12}{4,4,4} = \\frac{12!}{4!4!4!}$."
    },

        "$8^{12}$",
        "$12^7$"

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "For each friend, you choose a non-empty subset of the 3 available card types. There are $2^3 = 8$ total subsets. We subtract the 1 empty set (since everyone must get at least one card), leaving 7 choices per friend. For 12 friends, this is $7^{12}$."

        "$5!$",

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Treat the block of three U's ('UUU') as a single letter. We then need to arrange 5 distinct objects in total: 'UUU', 'N', 'S', 'A', 'L'. This can be done in exactly $5!$ ways."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "This is a <strong>Stars-and-Bars</strong> problem. We have $n=4$ balls (stars) and $k=4$ boxes, needing $k-1 = 3$ dividers (bars). We choose 3 positions out of $4+3=7$ total positions, giving $\\binom{7}{3}$."

        "$0$",
        "$n!$"

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The Binomial Theorem states $(x+y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k}x^ky^{n-k}$. If we set $x=1$ and $y=-1$, the left side evaluates simply to $(1 - 1)^n = 0^n = 0$."

        "$\\binom{10}{2}$",
        "$9!$"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "This is a more difficult question since the reformulation is more difficult to see. Every subset of the digits $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\}$ forms exactly one valid decreasing sequence when sorted, except the empty set $\\emptyset$ and the set $\\{0\\}$ (since a positive integer cannot be empty or just '0'). There are $2^{10}$ subsets in total, minus those 2 invalid ones, giving $2^{10} - 2$."

      "explanation": "First, fulfill the restriction by giving 1 penny to each of the 4 children. You now have $10 - 4 = 6$ identical pennies left to distribute freely among the 4 children. Using Stars-and-Bars with $n=6$ and $k=4$, we get $\\binom{6+4-1}{4-1} = \\binom{9}{3}$."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The reformulation to <strong>Stars-and-Bars</strong> here is also difficult to spot but possible! You can think of the 6 possible numbers on a die as 6 distinguishable 'bins'. The 5 dice you roll act as 5 identical 'balls' distributed into these bins. With $n=5$ and $k=6$, the formula gives $\\binom{5+6-1}{6-1} = \\binom{10}{5}$."
