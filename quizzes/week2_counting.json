      "choices": [
        "$100!$",
        "$2^{100}$",
        "The numbers are equal"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "When comparing $100!=100\\cdot 99 \\cdot 98 \\cdot \\dots$ to $2\\cdot 2 \\cdot 2\\cdot \\dots$, we see both multiply 100 numbers. The terms in $100!$ are clearly larger than 2 for almost all terms."

      "text": "How many functions $f: \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\to \\{a, b\\}$ are there?",
      "choices": [
        "$3^2 = 9$",
        "$2^3 = 8$",
        "$3! = 6$",
        "$2 \\cdot 3 = 6$"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Exponent Rule: For each of the 3 elements in the domain, there are 2 choices in the codomain. <br>Total = $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^3 = 8$."

      "text": "You want to form a committee of 3 students out of 7. How many options are there?",

        "$(7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5)/(3\\cdot 2)$",
        "None of the above"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The number $7\\cdot 6\\cdot 5$ represents the number of ways to pick 3 students in a specific order. We overcount by the number of ways the committee of size 3 can be ordered, so we divide by $3! = 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$."

        "$49$",
        "$7$"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "If all 7 people shake 6 hands, we find $7 \\times 6 = 42$. However, this counts every handshake twice (once for each person involved). So we divide by 2."

        "$5! \\cdot 3! \\cdot 4!$"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "By the Multiplication Rule, the total number of outfits is the product of the number of choices for each item: $5 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 60$."

      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "For each of the 6 digits, we have 10 choices. So the answer is $10^6$ by the Exponent Rule."

        "$26^4 \\cdot 100$"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "We use the Multiplication Rule for each part of the plate: <br>1. One letter: $26$ options.<br>2. Two digits: $10 \\times 10 = 100$ options.<br>3. Three letters: $26 \\times 26 \\times 26 = 26^3$ options.<br>Total: $26 \\times 100 \\times 26^3 = 26^4 \\cdot 100$."

  "correct": 2,
  "explanation": "<strong>Complement Rule:</strong> It is easier to count the PINs that have <em>no</em> 7s and subtract that from the total. <br>Total PINs = $10^3 = 1000$. <br>PINs with no 7 (using digits 0-6, 8-9) = $9 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 9^3$. <br>Answer: $1000 - 729 = 271$."

    "$2^{10} = 1024$",
    "$10 \\cdot 10 = 100$"

  "correct": 1,
  "explanation": "Since the order now matters, we do not divide by 2. We have 10 choices for President, and then 9 remaining choices for VP. <br>Total = $10 \\times 9 = 90$."
