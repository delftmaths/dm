      "prompt": "Since $N > 1$, by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, it must have a prime factor, call it $q$. Is $q$ in our original list?",
      "hint": "Check if $N$ is divisible by $p_1$. What is the remainder? What about $p_2$?",
      "reveal": "If $q$ were in our list, say $q = p_i$, then $q$ would divide the product $p_1 \\dots p_n$. However, since $q$ divides $N$, it must divide the difference $N - (p_1 \\dots p_n) = 1$."

      "prompt": "What is the contradiction?",
      "hint": "Can a prime number divide 1?",
      "reveal": "A prime number $q$ cannot divide 1. Therefore, the prime factor $q$ cannot be in our finite list $p_1, \\dots, p_n$. This contradicts the assumption that the list contained *all* prime numbers."
