      "hint": "Plug $n=1$ into both the left side $(x+y)^1$ and the right side (the sum).",
      "reveal": "For $n=1$, the left side is $(x+y)^1 = x+y$. The right side is $\\binom{1}{0}x^0y^1 + \\binom{1}{1}x^1y^0 = y + x$. Both sides match!"

      "hint": "Split off one factor of $(x+y)$.",
      "reveal": "We can write it as: $(x+y)^{n+1} = (x+y) \\cdot (x+y)^n$. By the induction hypothesis, this is $(x+y) \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k}x^k y^{n-k}$."

      "reveal": "The expansion gives: $\\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k}x^{k+1}y^{n-k} \\quad + \\quad \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k}x^ky^{n+1-k}$."

      "hint": "This is a famous rule from Pascal's Triangle!",
