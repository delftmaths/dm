    {
      "prompt": "We will do a proof by contradiction. What is the first line of the proof?",
      "hint": "In a proof by contradiction, you begin by assuming the <em>negation</em> of the statement you want to prove.",

    {
      "prompt": "What properties then follow about $\\sqrt{2}$?",
      "hint": "A rational number can be written as one integer divided by another integer. Write this in symbols.",
      "reveal": "Then there exist integers $a,b$ such that $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{b}$."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "How can we eliminate the square root?",
      "hint": "Try squaring both sides of the equation.",
      "reveal": "Squaring gives $2 = \\frac{a^2}{b^2}$, so $a^2 = 2b^2$."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What can you now conclude about $a$?",
      "hint": "If $a^2$ is even, what does that say about $a$?",
      "reveal": "Since $a^2$ is even, $a$ must be even (this can be shown either via prime divisors or via proof by contradiction). So $a = 2k$ for some integer $k$."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "Why does this imply that $b$ is also even?",
      "hint": "Plug in $a=2k$ into $a^2=2b^2$.",
      "reveal": "Hence $2b^2=a^2=(2k)^2=4k^2$ and so $b^2=2k^2$ is even. As above, since $b^2$ is even, $b$ must be even."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "The fact that $a,b$ are both even does not currently give a contradiction. What should we add to this proof (and where) to ensure it does?",
      "hint": "Look back at where we defined $a$ and $b$. Is there a way to assume they are not both even there?",
      "reveal": "When choosing integers $a$ and $b$ such that $\\sqrt{2}=a/b$, if both $a$ and $b$ are even, then $a/b=a'/b'$ where $a'=a/2$ and $b'=b/2$ are integers. We can repeatedly apply this until $a$ and $b$ are not both even."
